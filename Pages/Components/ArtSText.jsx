Numerous techniques exist for creating the model, yet they can all be categorized into two primary groups. The first involves crafting a traditional physical model using materials such as clay, wood, or gypsum. The second employs digital 3D design, where objects are formed within software.</div>

                                        <div className="smText">Elements that can be efficiently and swiftly created physically, such as sculptures, are fashioned using standard materials like clay, gypsum, or wood. Subsequently, we utilize 3D scanning techniques to translate the physical model into a virtual space, where our 3D artists finalize the design. Once the 3D design is finalized, sharing renders with our clients becomes crucial. This practical step allows them to assess and fine-tune the envisioned concept, ensuring that the future object aligns perfectly with their expectations before granting the green light for prototyping stage.
